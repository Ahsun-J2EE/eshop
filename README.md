A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Basically, I didn't use firebase as a backend server before, that's why It was really hard time for me to do the every steps of the project. In the case of every steps, first I learned then I have applied to the project. However, through this project I'm learning something new. I'm unable to complete this project within the deadline cause it's totally a new project to me.

Step-1
I have completed step-1. In this step I watched video tutorial then applied to my project. Step-1 was quite easy to complete but I have faced some difficulties. I was focused about my designing that's why it tooks lot of time from me, also I was busy with my office work. Now, I'm thinking about second step. Hope I'll will complete this step soon.

Step-2
I'm working with step-2

Step-3
This is the most challenging part of the project.
